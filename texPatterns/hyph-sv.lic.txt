% Last update: 1994-03-03 (March 3, 1994).
% Revision history:
% 1991-01-08: First version available for anonymous FTP.
% 1991-08-08: Changed \aa to \aa0 at end of line, to stop TeX from
%             concatenating the patterns.
% 1991-09-03: Cleaned up lots of inconsistencies in the dictionary.
%             As a consequence, the patterns shrunk a lot.  Also
%             added some 4000 one-syllable words, some of which were
%             hyphenated by the old patterns, and some 1500 compound
%             words, about half of which were incorrectly hyphenated
%             by the old patterns.
% 1991-11-01: Added another some 6200 compound words, all of which were
%             incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
% 1991-11-13: Added another some 6500 compound words, all of which were
%             incorrectly hyphenated by the old patterns.
% 1992-01-30: Changed macros to ^^, for use with LaTeX and dc fonts.
% 1994-03-03: The hyphenated dictionary now contains about 118,000 words.
%             The hyphenation now works much better for compound words.
%             Patgen parameters: 1 2 20, 2 1 8, 1 4 7, 3 2 1, 1 10000 4.

% This file contains Swedish hyphenation patterns for TeX.  It assumes
% that you have fonts with the Swedish letters in the positions where
% they occur in ISO Latin 1 (ISO 8859/1):
% Letter:   \AA  \"A  \"O  \'E  \aa  \"a  \"o  \'e
% Position: "C5  "C4  "D6  "C9  "E5  "E4  "F6  "E9
%
% Load this file into initex after plain.tex (or lplain.tex, splain.tex,
% or whatever).
%
% The patterns were generated in such a way that they will hyphenate
% correctly if \lefthyphenmin>=1 and \righthyphenmin>=2.
%
% These hyphenation patterns work quite well for simple words, but not
% quite as well for compound words.  I'm working on improving the quality,
% by adding more words.  If you know any Swedish words which are not
% correctly hypheneted using these patterns, or if you have questions or
% comments, please contact me:
